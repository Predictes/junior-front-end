# Junior-front-end Task

Hi!

Than you for joing the recruitment for Junior Front-end developer at Predictes. 

Use CodePen, JS Bin or any different platform as playground (create an account and create new pen, once youâ€™re done send us link to your work).
Please remember that:
- it should work out of the box (we should click link and be able to use it)
- we should be able to take a look at your code :)

Pay attention to code quality, formatting, conventions etc.

You can find all necessary images and sounds in this repository.


## Here are the tasks for you:

## Task #1
The task is to prepare a responsive two-level menu based with the provided template.

### Guidelines:
a) The 2nd level of the menu on screens with width >= 1200px should appear when you move the cursor over a given item.
b) Expanding the menu on screens with a width <1200px should be animated and the remaining elements on the page should be darkened.
c) The menu should be closed both by clicking on the menu icon and clicking outside the menu area.

### Notes:
1) Animations should limit JavaScript to a minimum.
2) The solution of the task should not use any additional libraries.

## Task #2
The task is to prepare an animal farm ;)

### Guideliness:
a) The screen should be divided into 9 rectangles. 8 of them should contain a picture with an animal and the last picture with a farmer.
b) Clicking on the rectangle with the animal should initiate the sound of the sound associated with the animal (necessary materials in the sounds folder) and animation of the enlargement of the picture in the rectangle. 
c) Clicking on the rectangle with the farmer should initiate the firing of all sounds in a random order along with the animation of the currently active animal.
d) In addition, each rectangle should be assigned to one key, which pressing will have the same effect as clicking on a given rectangle.

### Notes:
1) Every click / press of a key should produce an effect even if the previous call has not finished.
2) The solution of the task should not use any additional libraries.
